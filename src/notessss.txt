The form method attribute specifies how data from a form should be submitted to the server. 
The two most commonly used methods are GET and POST
POST:
    When using the POST method, the form data is appended to the HTTP request body and sent to the server. 
    This method is typically used when you want to submit sensitive or large amounts of data, 
    such as login credentials or file uploads, as it doesn't expose the data in the URL

GET:
    On the other hand, the GET method appends the form data to the URL as query parameters, which makes it visible and bookmarkable. 
    It is typically used for fetching data or performing read-only operations.

300px: This is the minimum width that each grid column should have.
1fr: This is the maximum width that each grid column should have. 
    The fr unit represents a fraction of the available space, so 1fr indicates that the columns should expand and occupy an equal amount of space.
